KEY MARKING CRITERIA: 
// input vector format: [1.0 0.0 0.0] [0.0 1.0 0.0] [0.0 0.0 1.0] 
// always the same number of vectors as dimensions 
// program should parse arguments, infer dimension and solve 
// create a text file 'result.txt' with one number in it  

tasks: 
fix reduce so that it is correct for orthogonal bases 
fix reduce and listsieve so that no vector appears twice 
try to generalise the above 

write LLL 
test.
